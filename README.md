# WCA Delegate Report Template

Template used in my Delegate Reports for [WCA](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) competitions.

# What is this?

WCA Delegates, like myself at the time of writing this, have to write a report about the WCA competitions where we serve as such. This includes all sort of information about the competition, including the venue, team, schedule, budget, incidents, remarks, and more.

The WCA doesn't (yet) enforce a specific layout for these reports, but gives basic guidelines on which topics should be addressed.

After writing plenty of these, I found out that this succint template that groups several of these sections is able to include all the same information while mantaining an easier to read format, as well as making it simpler and more concise.

# Structure

The report is made of five sections:

- Equipment
- Venue
- Organization
- Incidents
- Remarks

I have included a homonymous Markdown file with the detail of the subsections that I write and what they should contain.

It's just a guide; normally I would add or remove sections from this template if I feel like something needs more specific detail.

Read the files in `Code` mode to see the comments that I added for each subsection.
